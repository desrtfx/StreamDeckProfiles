## Profile

This is a simple icons only profile, meaning that there is nothing complex going on, it's simply keyboard shortcuts decorated with pretty icons.

> Note: some of the buttons require that you configure the keyboard shortcuts within Gimp as these are not set by default. You can do this by going to: `Edit` > `Keyboard Shortcuts` and then searching for the function in question and then finally, setting a key combination of your choice. (Typically, these will be buttons set with the `Shift + Alt + <somekey>` combo).

### Homepage

Currently, these are the keys I use the most. You use may be different, feel free to swap buttons out from the extras folder.

### Extras

Currently has plenty of space for more buttons but so far these are all that I've needed. Do let me know if there are some additional icons that you would like.
