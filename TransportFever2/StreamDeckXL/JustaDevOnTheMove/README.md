## Profiles

This is a simple icons only profile, meaning that there is nothing complex going on, it's simply keyboard shortcuts decorated with pretty icons.

I've created 2 icon styles, both icon sets are available in the <a href="../../images/icons/">`icons`</a> directory, so feel free to mix-and-match.

### Style 01
