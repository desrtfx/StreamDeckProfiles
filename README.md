## How to use

### Download

Browse this repository and download the `.streamDeckProfile` file(s) of your choice.

### Installation

Once downloaded, you should be able to simply double click the file to install it into your Stream Deck.

Alternatevely, you can <a href="https://help.elgato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048424432-Elgato-Stream-Deck-How-to-Back-Up-and-Restore-Profiles" target="_blank">import the profile(s)</a> manually.

### Customisation

As per the [license](LICENSE.md), you're free to modify the profiles as you see fit in order to tailor them to your specific work/play style and specific key mappings.

Although all icons are extractable directly from the profile files, for your convenience, all icons used (and sometimes more) are available directly in the `icons` directory of each application. There are also a number of backgrounds availble in the `backgrounds` directory of each application, these are useful for customising your text buttons.
